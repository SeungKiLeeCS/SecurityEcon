    "It is rather difficult to come up with definitive evidence that these facilities are adequately protected because there is no hard number available for how much is going into the cybersecurity in these facilities. Therefore the evidence has to be somewhat circumstantial. This does not mean this evidence is weak by any chance because United States has never experienced critical cyber attack on its infrastruture. Even when the bill was proposed, Predident Obama mentioned himself that \"So far, no one has managed to seriously damange or disrupt our critical infrastructure networks.\"[1] This is remarkable because many of the major countries including China and South Korea has experienced a successful cyberattack. In this case, the abscence of record advocates for presence of strong protection.\n",

Cost of simply building a nuclear power plant in 2016, a critical infrastructure, is estimated to be 9 Billion [3]. Since 9,000,000,000 x 0.00206 = 18,530,000, if the P(damage) is greater than 0.206% then we are not putting in enough funding for protection of a nuclear power plant. Since there are 61 commercially operating nuclear power plants in US[4], P(damage) becomes 0.00338%. This number is same as probability of 9/11 excecuting out exactly as it did [5].\n",
